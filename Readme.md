# Gaussian Splatting Models

This repository hosts **Gaussian Splatting models** for real-time 3D rendering and visualization. These models are generated using the [Gaussian Splatting](https://repo-sam.inria.fr/fungraph/3d-gaussian-splatting/) technique, which represents a scene as a set of anisotropic 3D Gaussians instead of traditional meshes or point clouds.

## ðŸ“¦ Releases

Precompiled **Gaussian Splatting model files** (`.ply`) are available under the [Releases](https://github.com/khyron/Gaussian-Splatting/releases) section.
Download them to test directly in supported viewers, pipelines, or convert them into alternative formats for your workflow.

## ðŸ“‚ File Format

All models are stored in the **`.ply` (Polygon File Format / Stanford PLY)** format.

### PLY Format Description

* **Type**: ASCII or Binary
* **Usage**: Commonly used to store 3D data such as vertices, normals, colors, and in the case of Gaussian Splatting, additional attributes like scale and opacity.
* **Structure**:

  * A **header** that describes the properties of each element (vertex, face, Gaussian attributes).
  * A **body** that contains the actual data values.

For Gaussian Splatting models, the PLY file typically contains:

* `x, y, z` â†’ 3D position
* `nx, ny, nz` â†’ Normal direction
* `r, g, b` â†’ Color information
* `scale_x, scale_y, scale_z` â†’ Ellipsoid radii for splats
* `opacity` â†’ Transparency value

* [Stanford PLY Format Documentation](http://paulbourke.net/dataformats/ply/)
* [Wikipedia: Polygon File Format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PLY_%28file_format%29)
